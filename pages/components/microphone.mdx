# Microphone

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This documentation is under construction. We currently use the ReSpeaker Mic Array v2.0 for our robots.
</Callout>

## Hardware Setup

We use the ReSpeaker Mic Array v2.0 ([product link](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-Mic-Array-v2-0.html)), which features:

- 4 high-performance digital microphones
- 12 RGB LEDs
- USB connectivity
- Built-in algorithms for DOA (Direction of Arrival) and beamforming

The microphone connects to the Jetson Orin via USB as shown:

## Recording Audio

Here's a basic example of recording audio using the microphone:

```python
import numpy as np
import sounddevice as sd
import soundfile as sf

def record_audio(duration=10.0, sample_rate=44100, channels=1):
    """Record audio from the default microphone.

    Args:
        duration (float): Recording duration in seconds
        sample_rate (int): Sample rate in Hz
        channels (int): Number of audio channels
    """
    print("Recording...")
    audio_data = sd.rec(
        int(duration * sample_rate),
        samplerate=sample_rate,
        channels=channels,
        blocking=True
    )
    print("Done recording!")
    return audio_data

# Example usage
audio = record_audio()
sf.write("recorded_audio.wav", audio, 44100)
```

### Device Selection
The default audio device is usually correct, but you can:
- List available devices: `sd.query_devices()`
- Set a specific device: `sd.default.device = [device_id]`
- Get current device info: `sd.query_devices(sd.default.device[0])`

## Audio Signal Path

For the ReSpeaker MEMS microphones:

1. **Microphone Array** → MP34DT01 MEMS microphones capture audio
2. **Digital Processing** → Outputs PDM (Pulse-Density Modulation) data
3. **USB Interface** → Handles data transfer to the Jetson
4. **Software Stack**

## Physical Principles of Audio Recording

### MEMS Microphone Technology

The ReSpeaker uses MEMS (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Systems) microphones, specifically the MP34DT01. Here's how they work:

1. **Mechanical Structure**
   - A thin membrane (diaphragm) suspended over a fixed backplate
   - Forms a variable capacitor where the membrane moves with sound waves
   - Typical membrane size: 0.5-1mm diameter, ~1μm thick

2. **Sound to Electrical Conversion**

   ```
   Sound Wave → Membrane Vibration → Capacitance Change → Electrical Signal
   ```

3. **Digital Output**
   - Unlike analog mics, MEMS mics output digital PDM (Pulse Density Modulation)
   - PDM represents analog amplitude through pulse density:

     ```
     Analog: ～～～～
     PDM:   _▄_▄▄_▄_▄▄▄_▄  (Higher amplitude = more pulses)
     ```

### Array Processing

The ReSpeaker's 4-mic array enables:

1. **Beamforming**
   ```
   Mic 1: ----sound1----→
   Mic 2: ---sound1-delay→  → Digital Processing → Enhanced Signal
   Mic 3: --sound1-delay2→
   Mic 4: -sound1-delay3-→
   ```
   - Uses time differences between mics
   - Constructively combines desired direction
   - Destructively cancels other directions

2. **Direction of Arrival (DOA)**
   - Calculates sound source angle using:
     ```
     θ = arcsin(c × Δt / d)
     where:
     c = speed of sound
     Δt = time delay between mics
     d = distance between mics
     ```

### Sampling Process

1. **Temporal Sampling**
   ```
   Continuous: ～～～～～
   Sampled:    • • • • •
   ```
   - 44.1kHz standard (captures up to 22.05kHz per Nyquist)
   - Each sample is typically 16-bit (65,536 amplitude levels)

2. **Spatial Sampling**
   - 4 mics in circular array
   - Spatial Nyquist frequency: f = c/(2d)
   - Where d is mic spacing (~4.36cm on ReSpeaker)

### Digital Signal Chain

```
                                            ┌→ Beamforming
Sound → MEMS → PDM → Decimation Filter → PCM┼→ DOA
                                            └→ Audio Output
```
