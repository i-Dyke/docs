# Speaker

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  This documentation is under construction and incomplete. We are in the process
  of choosing a speaker that works well with our robots.
</Callout>


At the moment, we are using the this speaker from Digikey ([1](https://www.digikey.com/short/5t82t2h9))
It can be wired up to the Jetson Orin as such:

<Image src={speaker_and_mic_wiring} alt="Speaker and Mic Wiring" width={500} 
height={312} style={{ maxWidth: '100%', height: 'auto' }}/>

Here is an example of code to play a wav file on the speaker:

```python
import numpy as np
import sounddevice as sd
import soundfile as sf


sound, sr = sf.read("test.wav") #sr is the sampling rate. sound is a numpy array.
sd.play(audio, sr, blocking=True)
```

The default device that `sounddevice` use is most often the right one. Even if 
two speakers are used, they will be both plugged into one amp. If additional speakers
or mics are plugged in or if default selection is incorrect, you can list the
available devices using `sd.query_devices()` and select one using `sd.default.device = ...`

### From Bits to Sound

This is the path sound takes on the linux system.

1. **Sound Server**: Most basically, orchestrates device driver to work with 
mulitplexing. Examples include PulseAudio, Pipewire, JACK.
2. **Driver**: The Advanced LInux Sound Architecture (ALSA) drives the digital 
to analog conversion and writes the bytes to the output.
3. Sound Card acts as the Digital to Analog Converter (**DAC**)
Controlled by the driver. May have additional hardware here such as amps and pre-amps.
4. Speaker converts electrical signal to sound.

Our implementation uses `soundfile` and `sounddevice`, which are libraries built to 
manipulate audio files. Their functionalities for interacting with the sound card and 
getting processed data is through PortAudio, an abstraction layer atop of ALSA.
These can be set up on a fresh Jetson using `sudo apt-get install libportaudio2`
and `pip install soundfile sounddevice`. ALSA is built into the kernel on the Jetson 
and does not need to be installed.

### Other Terms

- **Sampling Rate** = how many times per second information is captured. 44.1 khz 
is common for audio, 48 khz for video, and higher specification audio have higher sampling rates such as 96 khz.
- **Multiplexing** = the process of interleaving multiple signals (eg. Spotify 
and Youtube) into a single signal at the same time. May require resampling if sampling rates are different.
