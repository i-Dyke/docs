# Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of designing and building your own robot, from CAD to running a walking policy. The basic steps are:

1. [Design the robot in CAD](./cad.mdx)
2. [Test the robot in simulation, to make sure that it works](./simulate.mdx)
3. [Build the robot](./build.mdx)
4. [Flash your robot's control board with the necessary firmware](./firmware.mdx)
5. [Get your robot to do something interesting](./use.mdx)

While these steps are sequential, it is recommended that you read through them all before getting started, since earlier steps will make more sense if you understand where they are leading.
