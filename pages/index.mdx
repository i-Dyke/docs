Welcome to K-Scale Labs! We're developing a powerful and open-source humanoid platform for enthusiastic roboticists like ourselves.
Our first two robots, Stompy and Stompy Mini are completely open source, and this documenation will provide a guide to build Stompy Mini yourself.
The goal of this guide is to help you build Stompy Mini easily.

We'd love it if you'd join us on this journey!

### Naming Conventions

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
These naming conventions are still being developed and are likely to change.
</Callout>

K-Scale robot names should follow the convention `<application>-<series>`.

| Designation | Category | Description |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| P | Prototyping | This designation is for robots that are intended to be used primarily for prototyping and experimentation, without having immediate commercial applications. |
| I | Industrial | This designation is for robots that are intended to be used in industrial settings, such as manufacturing, assembly and other tasks.
| D | Domestic | This designation is for robots that are intended to operate in a home environment, such as cleaning, assistance, and other domestic tasks. |
