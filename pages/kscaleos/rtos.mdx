# Real-Time Operating System

Here are some high-level notes about the architecture of the real-time operating system:

- We build the full Linux kernel for K-Scale OS using our own extensions to Buildroot
- The main control loop is implemented as a daemon process that runs at boot, using the `SCHED_RR` scheduling class
- We enable `PREEMPT_RT` to ensure that we can meet our hard real-time requirements
- The control loop itself is implemented in Rust, which exposes an gRPC interface over HTTP for communicating with other components
  - We implement a Python API for interacting with the HTTP server from userspace, allowing users to upload Klang programs
