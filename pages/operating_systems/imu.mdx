# IMU

IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit. It is a device that measures the orientation and motion of a robot. Specifically, typical IMUs have three sensors:

- **Accelerometer**: This measures linear acceleration by measuring forces exerted on the device. On Earth this usually means the force of gravity, but other forces are measured as well.
- **Gyroscope**: This measures angular velocity, or the rate of rotation around an axis. This is done by measuring the Coriolis force, which is proportional to the object's rotation.
- **Magnetometer**: This measures the orientation of the device relative to the Earth's magnetic field. This is used to determine the device's heading.

This documentation is under construction and incomplete. We are in the process of choosing an IMU that works well with our robots.
