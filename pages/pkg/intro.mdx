# K-Scale API

The K-Scale API is a way to programmatically interact with the K-Scale platform. It is available in Python, Rust, and as a CLI.

## Installation

First, you need to get an API key from [here](https://kscale.store/keys), then export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export KSCALE_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

### Python

To install the Python API, use `pip`:

```bash
pip install kscale
```

This will also install the `kscale` CLI.

### Rust

To install just the Rust component of the API, use `cargo`:

```bash
cargo add kscale
```
