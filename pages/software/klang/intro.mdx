## Introduction

Klang is a domain-specific language (DSL) for programming robots.

At present, we are working on our parser with Rust. From this, we will hopefully allow users to be able to write Klang code that can be compiled into motor control commands for our robots.

Think Midjourney - we want users to be able to apply various tags for our model to understand implicitly and generate motor control commands.

### Architecture

Below is a diagram showing the architecture of the Klang neural interpreter.
