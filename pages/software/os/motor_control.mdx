# Motor Control

## On-device Control

Most motors implement some form of PID control to convert a target position to the relevant currents to apply to each phase of the motor.

## Communication Protocols

There are multiple communication protocols that can be used to communicate with motors.

- **CAN**: CAN is a protocol that is widely used in the automotive industry. It is a serial protocol that uses a 0.5-1.0Mbps bitrate.
- **EtherCAT**: EtherCAT is a protocol that is widely used in the automation industry. It is a serial protocol that uses a 100Mbps bitrate.
