## Onshape to URDF Converter

`kol` is what we use at K-Scale for interacting with OnShape. It is a wrapper around the OnShape API that allows us to easily import parts, postprocess them, and export them in a variety of formats. This is a key part of our mission to make robots more accessible --- Onshape is free, easy to use, and encourages open-source development through FeatureScript.

In a single CLI, we support functions such as mesh simplification, mesh merging, joint cleanup, transferring between MJCF/URDF formats, and more.

### Installation

```bash
pip install 'kscale-onshape-library[all]'
```

### Usage

The KOL CLI provides several subcommands for different operations:

```bash
kol <subcommand> [options]
```

Available subcommands:
- `run`: Download from Onshape and post-process
- `download`: Only download from Onshape
- `postprocess`: Post-process an existing URDF
- `pybullet`: Run PyBullet simulation

#### Download and Post-process

To download a model from Onshape and apply post-processing:

```bash
kol run <onshape-document-url> <output-directory>
```

To see additional configuration options, consult the config file [here](https://github.com/kscalelabs/onshape/blob/master/kol/onshape/config.py).

#### Download Only

To only download a model from Onshape without post-processing:

```bash
kol download <document-url> <output-directory>
```

Options are similar to the `run` subcommand.

#### Post-process Existing URDF

To apply post-processing to an existing URDF file:

```bash
kol postprocess <urdf-path>
```

#### PyBullet Simulation

To run a PyBullet simulation with the processed URDF:

```bash
kol pybullet <urdf-path> [options]
```

Options:
- `<urdf_path>`: Path to the URDF file to simulate (required)
- `--dt FLOAT`: Time step for simulation (default: 0.01)
- `-n`, `--hide-gui`: Hide the PyBullet GUI
- `--no-merge`: Do not merge fixed links
- `--hide-origin`: Do not show the origin of the robot
- `--show-inertia`: Visualize the inertia frames
- `--see-thru`: Use see-through mode for robot visualization
- `--show-collision`: Show collision meshes

### Examples

1. Download and post-process an Onshape model:

```bash
kol run https://cad.onshape.com/documents/... ./robot
```

2. Post-process an existing URDF:

```bash
kol postprocess ./path/to/model.urdf voxel_size=0.005
```

3. Run PyBullet simulation:

```bash
kol pybullet ./output/model.urdf
```
