## The `kscale` CLI

The `kscale` CLI is what we use to interact with the [K-Scale store](https://kscale.store/). This will allow for users to download and upload URDF files completely through our CLI or through our website, with support for auto-fetching the latest version of URDF and mesh files from continually updating Onshape documents.

### Installation

```bash
pip install kscale
```

### Usage

```bash
kscale <subcommand> [options]
```

Where `<subcommand>` is either `urdf` or `pybullet`.

### Subcommands

#### URDF

The `urdf` subcommand allows you to manage URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) files in the K-Scale store.

Usage:

```bash
kscale urdf <command> <artifact_id> [options]
```

Available commands:

- `download`: Download a URDF artifact from the K-Scale store.
- `info`: Display information about a URDF artifact.
- `remove-local`: Remove locally cached URDF files.

##### Examples

1. Download a URDF:
   ```bash
   kscale urdf download <artifact_id>
   ```

2. Get URDF information:
   ```bash
   kscale urdf info <artifact_id>
   ```

4. Remove local URDF cache:
   ```bash
   kscale urdf remove-local <artifact_id>
   kscale urdf remove-local all
   ```

#### PyBullet

The `pybullet` subcommand allows interaction with PyBullet functionalities. The specific commands and options for this subcommand are not provided in the given code snippet.

Usage:

```bash
kscale pybullet [options]
```

For detailed information on the available commands and options for the `pybullet` subcommand, please refer to the `pybullet.py` file or run:

```bash
kscale pybullet --help
```

### Notes

- The CLI uses asynchronous operations for improved performance.
- An API key is required for certain operations. Set it as the `KSCALE_API_KEY` environment variable or in your config file.
- The CLI uses a local cache to store downloaded artifacts. The cache location can be configured in the settings.

For more detailed information on each command and its options, use the `--help` flag with any command or subcommand.
