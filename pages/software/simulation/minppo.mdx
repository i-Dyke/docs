## Minimal PPO Implementation

```bash
pip install minppo
```

We provide a minimal implementation of training a robotic agent to do simple tasks, using the Brax framework.

## Installation

Brax is a versitile physics engine for training agents in reinforcement learning that can work on your local computer or on a cluster. The easiest way to install the `minppo` package is to use `pip`:

```bash
pip install minppo
```

### Command Line Interface

There are some default configurations in the `minppo/configs` directory which you can use to get started:

```bash
minppo train stompy_pro
```

Alternatively, you can specify the path to the config file directly:

```bash
minppo train configs/stompy_pro.yaml
```

Additionally, you can use dot notation to override specific parameters:

```bash
minppo train configs/stompy_pro.yaml 'rl.num_env_steps=1000'
```

You can visualize the environment with:

```bash
minppo env stompy_pro
```

Finally, you can run inference on a trained model with:

```bash
minppo infer stompy_pro 'inference.model_path=path/to/model.pkl'
```
