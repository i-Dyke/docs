Klang is a domain-specific language (DSL) for programming robots.

<Image alt="Klang Interface" src={klang_interface} style={{ width: "100%", marginTop: "1em" }} />

Klang is built into K-Scale OS, and is designed to be a simple and flexible way to get started building robot applications. Right now, it is basically a glorified templating engine. Klang commands are executed by the neural interpreter described below. Here is a sample Klang program:

```
> wave [arm] arm {
    > wave joint [joint] twice {
        move joint [joint] on the [arm] arm to 90
        move joint [joint] on the [arm] arm to 0
    }

    " wave joint [1] twice
    " wave joint [2] twice
    " wave joint [3] twice
}

> wave both arms {
    " wave [right] arm
    " wave [left] arm
}

" wave both arms
```

This converts to the following tree:

```
wave both arms {
  wave right arm {
    wave joint 1 twice {
      move joint 1 on the right arm to 90
      move joint 1 on the right arm to 0
    }
    wave joint 2 twice {
      move joint 2 on the right arm to 90
      move joint 2 on the right arm to 0
    }
    wave joint 3 twice {
      move joint 3 on the right arm to 90
      move joint 3 on the right arm to 0
    }
  }
  wave left arm {
    wave joint 1 twice {
      move joint 1 on the left arm to 90
      move joint 1 on the left arm to 0
    }
    wave joint 2 twice {
      move joint 2 on the left arm to 90
      move joint 2 on the left arm to 0
    }
    wave joint 3 twice {
      move joint 3 on the left arm to 90
      move joint 3 on the left arm to 0
    }
  }
}
```

## Neural Interpreter

Below is a diagram showing the architecture of the Klang neural interpreter.
