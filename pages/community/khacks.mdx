We are a humanoid company in Palo Alto, focused on creating powerful, useful, and open source humanoids. We love robots. Come build something cool and make tangible progress on your robotics project!

Bring your existing robot! We encourage working on and demonstrating your projects.

  - You're welcome to bring your own tent or mattress pad as well
- **Parking**
  - Parking is limited, so carpooling is strongly encouraged
  - Please don't block any neighbors' driveway

## Challenges

K-Scale Hackathon is a robotics hackathon. The goal is to make useful and powerful robots. You are free to build new any robotics related project you desire or improve your current existing work. Here are some things we would like to see:

### Hardware
- Robot manipulator design

### Software
- VR-based teleoperation
- Data collection and artifact hosting platforms

### Electrical
- Create custom motor controllers
- Design Jetson carrier boards
- Optimize communication protocols

### Machine Learning
- Deploy ML models in simulation
- Integrate speech models and LLMs for voice assistants
- Develop computer vision systems for face recognition

## Equipments

We'll have a bunch of random equipment around for the stuff that we usually work on - Jetsons, GPUs, a bunch of 3D printers, electronics bench, vhand tools.

For 3d printer usage please find Matt, he will be located in the detatched print garage and will print your necessary parts.

## Prizes

The best hacks will be judged by technical execution and creativity. Cool and hard ideas preferred. To be eligible for a prize the project must be open-sourced.
