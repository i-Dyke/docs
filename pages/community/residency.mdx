Are you interested in hacking on robots for a couple weeks?

As part of the residency, we provide room and board in Silicon Valley, plus equipment and robots.

## Equipment

- 3D printers
- Lots of actuators of different varieties
- Batteries, sensors, and other standard robot hardware
- Electronics bench
- GPUs
- Edge devices (Jetsons, Qualcomm boards)

## Expected outcomes

- At the end of the two week residency, we will have a demo day where you will show what you've built.

## Potential ideas

- Getting a robot to do a simple task, like washing dishes
- Implementing a recent paper that you found interesting on physical hardware
- Building a prototype PCB
- Designing and 3D printing your own robot
- Any other robotics-related ideas which you think you will find interesting
